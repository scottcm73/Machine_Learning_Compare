<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this project, I will attempt to create a machine learning comparison object with python. It is intended to work with all kinds of continuous predictive models. These include all types of linear, and multilinear regression. They also include artificial neural networks.






### Built With

* python
* pandas
* sklearn
* eventually torch





<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started



### Prerequisites


You are going to need pandas, sklearn (known as scikit-learn during installation, but sklearn during importation), and torch.



### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/scottcm73/Machine_Learning_Compare.git
   ```
2. Open terminal.
3. Install pip packages on computer but do not go to new cloned folder yet. 
   pip install pandas scikit-learn 
   pip install torch
3. Go to cloned folder Machine_Learning_Compare with the command:
   pipenv install

4. If the pipenv install command hangs while attempting to lock try the command:

   pipenv lock --clear

5. Pipenv lock --clear may give you an error the first time. If so, try it again.

6. Now, try the command pipenv install torch. This is what I had to do to install torch with pipenv.
